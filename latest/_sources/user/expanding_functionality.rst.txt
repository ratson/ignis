Expanding functionality
========================

Most of the features you need should be available in the `API Reference <../api/index.html>`_.
owever, if the feature you are looking for is not there, this page may help you.

Since Ignis uses Python, you can take advantage of its many benefits, features, and modules to expand functionality, including the use of native PyGObject.

For a more detailed understanding of how Ignis works and to help you add extra features, it is highly recommended to read the following resources:

- `PyGObject User Guide <https://pygobject.gnome.org/guide/index.html>`_
- `GObject Guide <https://pygobject.gnome.org/tutorials/gobject.html>`_
- `PyGObject API Reference <https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/>`_

.. hint::
    The `Developer Guide <../dev/index.html>`_ will also be very helpful.
